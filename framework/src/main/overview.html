    <p>Gravity is a light-weight <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">Inversion-of-Control 
        (IoC) / Dependency-Injection</a> and configuration management framework.</p>
    <p>The framework allows multiple ways of configuring the components via a plugin model and comes with a default 
        Beanshell plugin.</p>
    <p>This is a proxy-based solution that allows constructor-injection, method-injection and combo-injection 
        (a combination of constructor- and method-injection techniques).</p>
    <p>This is not an AOP solution and hence there is no built-in solution for interceptors or mixins; there are 
        lots of other good frameworks for this. However, there is a hook to allow proxy-based AOP solutions 
        (like dynaop) to be plugged-in, to weave the components.</p>
