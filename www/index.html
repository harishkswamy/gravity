		<h4>What?</h4>
		<p>This is a light-weight, flexible dependency injection framework that allows multiple 
            forms of component configuration via a plugin architecture. The framework comes with 
            a default BeanShell plugin for configuring the components.

		<p>This is a proxy-based solution that allows constructor-injection, setter-injection and 
            combo-injection (a combination of constructor- and setter-injection techniques).

		<p>This is not an AOP solution and hence there is no built-in solution for interceptors or 
            mixins; there are lots of other good frameworks for this. But there is a hook that can 
            be used to plugin proxy-based AOP solutions (like dynaop) to weave the components.

		<h4>Why?</h4>
		<p>I wanted a lean framework with minimum dependencies and least resistance to manage 
            application dependencies, and Gravity was born.
