        <h4>What?</h4>

        <p>This is a dependency and configuration management framework that allows multiple forms
        of configuration via a plugin architecture with a primary focus on the <em>Dependency
        Injection / Invertion of Control (IoC)</em> design pattern. The framework comes with a
        default BeanShell plugin for configuring the components.</p>

        <p>This is a proxy-based solution that allows constructor-injection, setter-injection and
        combo-injection (a combination of constructor- and setter-injection techniques).</p>

        <p>This is not an AOP solution and hence there is no built-in solution for interceptors or
        mixins; there are lots of other good frameworks for this. However, there is a hook to allow
        proxy-based AOP solutions (like dynaop) to be plugged-in, to weave the components.</p>

        <h4>Why?</h4>

        <p>I wanted a lean framework with minimum dependencies and least resistance to manage
        application dependencies and configurations, and Gravity was born.</p>

        <h3>Status - beta - 26-May-2004</h3>

        <p>The first beta version has been released. There is now a new manual, please see the
        documentation section. The next beta will primarily have improved test suite, better code 
        coverage, bug fixes and minor feature enhancements.
