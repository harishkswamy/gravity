		<h4>What?</h4>
		<p>This is a light-weight, flexible dependency injection framework that allows multiple 
            forms of component configuration via a plugin architecture. The framework comes with 
            a default BeanShell plugin for configuring the components.

		<p>This is a proxy-based solution that allows constructor-injection, setter-injection and 
            combo-injection (a combination of constructor- and setter-injection techniques).

		<p>This is not an AOP solution and hence there is no built-in solution for interceptors or 
            mixins; there are lots of other good frameworks for this. However, there is a hook that 
            can be used to plugin proxy-based AOP solutions (like dynaop) to weave the components.

		<h4>Why?</h4>
		<p>I wanted a lean framework with minimum dependencies and least resistance to manage 
            application dependencies, and Gravity was born.
            
        <h3>Status - 12-May-2004</h3>
        <p>The source in CVS is functional although may be in alpha status. I am expecting to add
            a couple more features and push out a beta in the next couple weeks.
