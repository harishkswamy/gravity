                <h4>Gravity Features</h4>
                <p>These are some of the features implemented in Gravity. Feel free to discuss new features 
                in the mailing list.</p>
                
                <ul>
	                <p><li><em>Serves and injects components and data</em>: Gravity, as a 
                    	container, is capable of serving components and static data in the 
                    	form of lists and maps and capable of injecting pretty much anything.</li></p>
	                <p><li><em>Constructor and method injection</em>: Dependencies can be injected into 
                    	components via any constructor or method of the injected component.</li></p>
	                <p><li><em>Component instances follow a life cycle</em>: The phases of the life cycle are - 
	                	instantiation, injection, start-up and shutdown. Callbacks can be registered for the
	                	injection and start-up phases of the life cycle.</li></p>
	                <p><li><em>The life of the component instance is configurable</em>: Depending on the 
	                	strategy used by the component, the life of its instances will vary. The currently 
	                	available strategies are - Singleton, Pooling and Thread Local.</li></p>
	                <p><li><em>The life of the component instances can be changed dynamically</em>: When the
                    	strategy of the component is changed, the life of all instances of the component,
                    	irrespective of when the instance was obtained, will be changed to obey the new 
                    	strategy.</li></p>
                    <p><li><em>Component configuration may be of distributed nature</em>: Component 
                    	configurations can be gathered from anywhere in the classpath.</li></p>
                    <p><li><em>Component configuration is plugable</em>: Components can be configured
                    	via any of the several possible ways - pure Java, BeanShell, XML etc. BeanShell is 
                    	the framework default.</li></p>
                </ul>
